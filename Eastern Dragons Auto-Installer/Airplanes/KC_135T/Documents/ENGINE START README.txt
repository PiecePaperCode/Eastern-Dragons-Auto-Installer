Engine Start procedure (Ground).

Engine Start Sequence is 3,4,1,2.

To start the engines, you need to open the starter subpanel as well as the throttle subpanel by clicking on the appropriate SimIcons.


The top switches are the starter switches. You can only switch one of these switches at the time (you cannot start more than one engine simultaneously). You cannot select an engine for an inflight starting procedure when the aircraft is on the ground. Same for the ground procedure when in flight.

The bottom switch is the starter selector. You can choose both starting systems on ground, but only pneumatic start in flight.
